# DbLogging.DotNetCore.Framework
Logging Framework in Dot Net Core, Sql Server, Dot Net Core Logging Framework and Dapper
This Framework is currently not scaled and can be taken up by developers to scale further.

I have had an idea to build a new Framework using Microsoft.Extensions for logging and log to Sql Server.
I will further evaluate to log using Elsatic .
